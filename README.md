<h1>👋 About Me</h1>
<p>Hi Bonjour, I’m Nicholas!</p>
<p>I’m a technical founder and architect. This page details my work on <strong>Governa Cloud</strong>, highlighting the product reasoning, platform design, and technical architecture behind the system. Poli Cloud is a global policy collaboration platform enabling policy actors to collaborate and develop policy across a range of sectors.</p>

<h2>🏗️ Three-Layer Platform Architecture</h2>
<p>The platform is designed as a clear three-layer structure:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Front-End Layer:</strong> React application, hosted separately on its own VM and volume, managing all UI and state for profiles, forums, dashboards, and forms.</li>
